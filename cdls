# Description: Combines the two commands, "cd" and "ls -a". This seemed necessary because it wasn't possible to use the same things as an alias - apparently?
# Usage: cdls

#

cd  
#
ls -a .

exit 0

# Well, so far, after a number of changes, this script doesn't work, but only shows items from the home directory. What does that mean? That cd isn't accepting input before the ls-a command runs?
