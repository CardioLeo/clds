# Description: Combines the two commands, "cd" and "ls -a". Currently not working.
# Usage: clds


# code suggested by Sara Kuenzi for ZSH; does not successfully complete cd portion of command when used with bash:
cd /$1 && ls -a
exit 0

# old code attempts:
# realpath was suggested, how do I use it?
# read -p "Enter your path:" input
# cd $input ls -a
